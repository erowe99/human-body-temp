### What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 ∘ C or 98.6 ∘ F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

### Conclusion:
According to the test above, 98.6 is not the true mean body temperature. The hypothesis tests rejected that hypothesis and most of the confidence intervals did not include 98.6 degrees.

The tests above support the notion that the true mean body temperture is slightly lower possibly around 98.12384615 to 98.37538462 degrees F with a margin of error of about 0.11%.

The body temperature between men and women was not significantly different enough to claim that they have different means.

This is all statistically speaking, but I don't think that it is practically significant. Human body temperature can fluctuate between a healthy range before it becomes "abnormal." As long is it is close to 98.6, within 1.0 degree, then you are likely healthy and fine.
